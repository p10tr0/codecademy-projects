# Project Description

In this project, we will create a contact book program to help our neighbour manage their phone contacts efficiently. Our neighbour recently bought a new phone and is eager to maintain an organised contact list. Tired of misplacing scraps of paper with phone numbers and scrolling through old messages to find contacts, they have asked for our help.

The contact program will allow for several options:

- **Add Contacts**: Input new names and phone numbers into the system.
- **View Contacts**: Display all saved contacts anytime for easy access.
- **Quit the Program**: Exit the application smoothly when they are finished.

The program structure is designed to focus on the core functionalities of adding and viewing contacts. We will follow several key steps to implement the program successfully:

- Gather user input through prompts.
- Implement conditional logic to handle different user choices.
- Store and manage contacts within a dictionary.

By the end of this project, our neighbour will have a user-friendly contact book to help them keep track of significant phone numbers without hassle.
